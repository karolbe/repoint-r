# The default resource bundle for the files listed in this directory but not in the subdirectories.
# The resouce bundle for the alt text will be looked up using the file name as the key/nlsid.
# To define the lookup for a specific image file named 'xxx.gif' (note: a image file of name containing
#    white spaces must have such a file if alt text is required. This is because nlsid/key can't contain white spaces.)
#   - create a properties file named 'xxx.gif.alt.properties'
#   - put nlsbundle= ...(bundle name)
#   - put nlsid= ...(nlsid defined in the bundle)
#   (note: The lookup file  specific image file named 'xxx.gif'
